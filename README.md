# DeleteApp
This console app can help with deleting big amount of files via part of the file name (for example, wrong configured Windows Configurated Manager spam lots of files in C:\Windows\CCM which are hard to delete with explorer or Total Commander) and writes a log file in .txt to parent folder.

IMPORTANT:
File.Delete() method deletes file irreversibly.
BE CAREFUL WITH SYSTEM FILES!!!
