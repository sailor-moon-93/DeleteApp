# DeleteApp
This app can help with deleting big amount of files via part of the file name (for example, wrong configured Configurated Manager spam lots of files in C:\Windows\CCM) and writes a log file in txt.
IMPORTANT:
File.Delete() method deletes file irreversibly.
BE CAREFUL WITH SYSTEM FILES!!!
